# Simple_API_Request

This is a simple Flickr API request using jQuery. I created this to serve as an example, or "template", for fellow student I tutor, who is learning about jQuery/Ajax. So, for teaching purposes I decided to keep everything (html, css, js) all in the same file (it's only 270 lines total, cut me some slack here). Using the Flickr API, this page is able to utilize a photo search that accepts various filters. Of these, I chose to give the user the option to filter by tag and by date. The page is also dynamcally sized, allowing for good readability regaurdless of window size, indicated by the changing colors on the page. This is all structured within a simple grid layout. Page regions are missing, again in attempts to keep the page as simple as possible, though this page does comply with basic heading structure (h1, h2). If you want to try out this page, simply paste it's contents into an html file of your own, and then open the page in your browser! Enjoy!
